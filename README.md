You can make the title bigger by applying some CSS styles to it. Hereâ€™s an updated version of the README.md file, where I've added instructions to style the title in a larger font.

Guess the Number Game
Overview
Welcome to the Guess the Number Game! ðŸŽ‰ This is a simple JavaScript-based game where you try to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 20. The game will give you feedback on whether your guess is too high, too low, or correct. The goal is to guess the correct number while keeping your score as high as possible!

To make the title bigger, you can add the following CSS:
h1 {
  font-size: 4rem;  /* Adjust the size as needed */
  text-align: center;
  margin-top: 20px;
}
Usage in the HTML file:
In your HTML, you can set the title as:

<h1>Guess the Number Game</h1>
This will ensure that the title is big and bold, making it stand out more.

Features:
Random Number Generation: A secret number is randomly generated between 1 and 20.
Guess Feedback: The game will tell you if your guess is too high, too low, or correct.
Score Tracking: Your score is tracked and displayed. You lose points with each incorrect guess.
Highscore: The highest score achieved during the session is saved.
Game Reset: You can play again with a reset score and new secret number.
How to Play:
The game will display a message "Start guessing...".
You will input your guess in the input box and click the "Check!" button.
If you guess the correct number, the game will show "ðŸŽ‰ Correct Number!" and update your score.
If your guess is too high or too low, the game will tell you that with the messages ðŸ“ˆ Too high! or ðŸ“‰ Too low!.
You can continue guessing until you either guess the correct number or run out of score points.
If your score reaches 0, you lose the game.
After the game ends, you can click the "Again" button to restart the game.
Code Overview:
HTML Structure: The game uses a basic HTML layout with an input field for guesses, a check button to submit guesses, and areas to display the secret number, score, high score, and messages.

CSS Styles: The game's visual elements are styled to give it an interactive feel. When you win, the background color turns green. The number display grows when you win.

JavaScript Logic:

Event listeners are used to handle user input and reset the game.
